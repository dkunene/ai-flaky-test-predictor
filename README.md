# AI Flaky Test Predictor

🚀 **AI-powered flaky test predictor for CI/CD pipelines.**  
Detects and flags unstable tests *before execution* using historical test data and machine learning — improving reliability and developer productivity.

---

## 📌 Problem
Flaky tests cause:
- Wasted CI/CD cycles  
- False failures  
- Reduced developer productivity  

Current tools detect flakiness **only after tests run**, not before.

---

## 💡 Solution
An **AI-powered flaky test predictor** that learns from historical test results to:
- Flag unstable tests before execution  
- Integrate seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines  
- Warn developers about high-risk tests  
- Suggest quarantine actions  
- Continuously improve with new data  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Collects past test results (pass/fail history, runtime variability, dependencies).  
2. Trains an ML model to classify tests as **stable** or **flaky**.  
3. When a new build runs:
   - Predicts which tests are at risk.  
   - Highlights them in real time.  
   - Provides actionable insights.
